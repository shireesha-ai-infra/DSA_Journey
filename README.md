# DSA Learning Journey

This repository documents my journey of mastering
Data Structures and Algorithms with a focus on:

- Pattern-based thinking
- Writing logic before coding
- Clean Python implementations
- Clear explanations
- Revisiting problems for mastery

## How I Study Each Problem
1. Understand the problem and write logic (no code)
2. Implement clean Python
3. Explain why the solution works

This repository prioritizes depth and clarity over quantity.
