## Hashing Pattern

### Why it exists
- Fast lookup
- Avoid repeated scanning
- Trade space for time

### When to use
- Checking if something exists
- Counting frequency
- Complement / pair problems

### How to think
- Ask: "What information should I remember?"
- Store it so future checks are O(1)

### Common mistakes
- Forgetting duplicates
- Overwriting values accidentally
- Using hashing when order matters

### Example problems
- Two Sum
- Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
